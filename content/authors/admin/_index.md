Adam Sabra is a Deep Learning Engineer graduating from the University of California, Davis as a Statistics major with a track focus in Machine Learning in June, 2021. He specializes in musical analysis via signal processing and deep learning techniques to quantify and separate various aspects of a song such as drums, bass, horns, and even vocals. Adam's main goal is to use these skills to forge a career path in audio research and even get a professorship down the line. If he's not developing his thesis or this website further, you can find Adam watching movies, listening to new music, or collecting vinyl records.
