*Everything mentioned below is my opinion and my opinion alone. Don’t agree with me or see something I mentioned differently? Leave a response and let’s talk about it!*

The music industry is one of the domains that has yet to see a full fledged restructuring as a direct cause of AI. The transition towards streaming caused a significant restructure — one that happened to be in favor of the labels and streaming services as opposed to the artists who bring the consumers in the first place. AI and ML have helped streaming services with music recommendations and targeted advertisements, but these technologies have yet to change the way we listen to/create music. This will change and it will be soon.

## Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning:

I’ll spare you the Venn diagram.

There are *many* differences between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. There are also many similarities between the two as well given the fact that Machine Learning a subset of Artificial Intelligence. We will take and define Machine Learning at face value — the ability for a machine to learn and gain insight about a certain topic. As for Artificial Intelligence, we will define it in as the machine’s ability to take action based on the certain rules and parameters given to it. Both technologies are often intertwined in real world use cases, but in this article (and for my own sanity) we will view the two as separate tools.

## In the Case of Machine Learning:

We’re all familiar with how our data is used to personalize nearly everything, be it from advertisements to user experience. While we may not know the technicalities behind how it is these algorithms determine what is a “good fit” for us or what isn’t, we do know that the metrics that are being used are constantly compared to others to see what similar patterns/hobbies users have in common. The same idea can be implemented into artists and their music.

When using Machine Learning in music, we can replicate how we dissect and study music, be it from a lyrical or sonic perspective, at scale. This means that the idea of “similarity” can go beyond how we consider two artists within the same genre to be similar. The measures of similarity will most likely transcend genre and time period as everything about one artist serves as context for another — similar to how my context determines not only the ads that I see but the ones you do as well.

However, if in the wrong hands, deep insights on what makes an artist who they are can be leveraged towards artificially inflating numbers to the highest bidder. This in turn becomes a new advertising market in music. The label or entity who shells out the highest payment gets put up top whereas independent artists could be left behind.

> We can develop deeper insights on what makes an artist who they are musically, what makes them unique, and much more. However, if used incorrectly, these insights will only favor those who can afford it.

## In the Case of Artificial Intelligence:

Do we want AI to be a tool to push humanity’s capabilities forward or do we want AI to automate tasks that we find incessant and boring? There are many cases where we can have both — having our cake and eating it too. However, in music, the answer is not as straight forward as we would like it to be.

Demixing audio is a mathematical attempt at separating the various components of a song as if they were recorded separately. [Spleeter by Deezer](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) does the best job of this that I have seen so far and I am even currently building one for my undergraduate capstone project. A tool like this can drastically change how producers can sample from songs. Like the way the drums sound in a section of the song that’s alongside a few other instruments that you don’t want? Demix it and use it for your song. It may not be perfect with its current capabilities but it will get you started. Using AI in music should be no different from how [VSTs work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology) — a plug-in to make the creative process easier.

It should be important to note that [music generation is very real thing](https://openai.com/blog/musenet/). Merge this with the top 5 companies’ computational resources and we have now shifted the music industry towards being provided thousands of hours of generated music at almost no cost to you. Now, I know what you’re thinking, *who would want to listen to music made by a computer?* You and I would when music generation mixes with our music taste profile and the music is now being constantly created and tuned to what we want. It’s not far from the realm of possibility and will be a reality sooner than we think it will be. The solution to this is simple, actively support human artists.

>We can build tools to help improve the workflow of artists in creating and manipulating unimaginable songs. However, if used incorrectly, these tools could automate artists out of a livelihood.

## Conclusion:

Artificial Intelligence can help usher in a new generation of creatives or replace them completely. All new and emerging technologies are similar at the core; their influence on how we operate is a direct product of how we influence their operations.
